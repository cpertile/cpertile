- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building consumer-facing web apps with React JS as a Front-End Software Engineer for Dextra.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot about the JavaScript ecosystem, specially how to test apps written with it. Iâ€™m learning CI/CD by implementing automated cloud jobs for testing with GitHub Actions.
- ðŸ‘¥ I find great meaning in helping other people learn, specially if it's something Iâ€™m familiar with.
- ðŸ’¬ Researching new technology is a passion of mine.
- ðŸ“« You can email me at cleberson.prt@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I desperately love rocket science and road engineering.
