🔭 I’m currently building consumer-facing web apps with React JS as a Front-End Software Engineer for Dextra.

🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about the JavaScript ecosystem, specially how to test apps written with it. I'm also learning CI/CD by implementing automated cloud jobs for testing with GitHub Actions.

👥 I find great meaning in helping other people learn, specially if learning about something I’m familiar with.
