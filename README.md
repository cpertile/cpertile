🔭 I’m currently building consumer-facing web apps with React JS as a Front-End Software Engineer for Dextra.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to handle a shared component library using the Lerna tool for JavaScript.

👥 I find great meaning in helping other people learn, specially if learning about something I’m familiar with.
